# Titanic Survival Prediction Project

The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during its maiden voyage, the RMS Titanic, considered "unsinkable," tragically sank after colliding with an iceberg. This project revolves around building a predictive model to answer the question: "What sorts of people were more likely to survive?"

## Project Overview

This predictive modeling project aims to analyze and predict the likelihood of survival based on various factors such as passenger demographics, ticket class, and other features. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we seek to uncover patterns in the Titanic dataset and build a model capable of predicting whether a passenger survived the disaster or not.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information about passengers on the Titanic, including features like age, gender, class, and whether they survived. The goal is to explore the data, identify relevant features, and train a predictive model.

## Project Structure

- **Data Exploration and Analysis:** Explore the dataset to understand its structure and relationships between variables.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and preprocess the data for machine learning.
- **Feature Engineering:** Create new features or transform existing ones to improve the model's predictive power.
- **Model Training:** Utilize machine learning algorithms to train a predictive model.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assess the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
- **Results and Conclusion:** Summarize findings, draw conclusions, and discuss potential improvements.
